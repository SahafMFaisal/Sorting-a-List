# Python List Sorting

This is a simple Python script that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Here</a>

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python sort_list.py
```
This will print the sorted list to the console.

Code Overview

The script contains a list of numbers:
```bash
numbers = [5, 1, 9, 3, 7]
```
The list is then sorted using Python's built-in sort() function:
```bash
numbers.sort()
```
Finally, the sorted list is printed to the console:
```bash
print(numbers)
```
